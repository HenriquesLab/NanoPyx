# Under Development, currently in alpha stage

Implementations of drift alignment and channel registration should be working, remaining features are under development and/or broken (for now)

Nanoscopy Python library (NanoPyx, the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging

---

## What is the NanoPyx ðŸ”¬ Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to [NanoJ](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Core), which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by heavily exploiting cython aided multiprocessing and simplicity. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).

Currently it implements the following approaches:

- A reimplementation of the NanoJ drift correction and channel registration methods
- More to come soonâ„¢

## Installation

You can install `NanoPyx` via [pip]:

```shell
pip install nanopyx
```

or if you want to install with all optional dependencies

```shell
pip install 'nanopyx[all]'
```

To install latest development version :

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx.git
```

### Notes for Mac users

If you wish to compile the NanoPyx library from source, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Homebrew from <https://brew.sh/>
- gcc, llvm and libomp from Homebrew through the command:

```shell
brew install gcc llvm libomp
```

## Run in jupyterlab within a docker container

```shell
docker run --name nanopyx1 -p 8888:8888 henriqueslab/nanopyx:latest
```
