Nanoscopy Python library (NanoPyx, the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging

---

## What is the NanoPyx ðŸ”¬ Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to NanoJ, which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by heavily exploiting cython aided multiprocessing and simplicity. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).

Currently it implements the following approaches:

- A reimplementation of the NanoJ drift correction
- ...
