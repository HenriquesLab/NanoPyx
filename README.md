# Under Development, currently in alpha stage
Implementations of drift alignment and channel registration should be working, remaining features are under development and/or broken (for now)

Nanoscopy Python library (NanoPyx, the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging

---

## What is the NanoPyx ðŸ”¬ Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to [NanoJ](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Core), which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by heavily exploiting cython aided multiprocessing and simplicity. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).

Currently it implements the following approaches:

- A reimplementation of the NanoJ drift correction
- ...

## Installation

You can install `NanoPyx` via [pip]:

```shell
pip install nanopyx
```

or if you want to install with all optional dependencies

```shell
pip install nanopyx[all]
```
