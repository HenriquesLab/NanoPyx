## **Get Started!**

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up **nanopyx** for local development.

1. Fork the **nanopyx** repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

   `$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/nanopyx.git`

3. Follow the installation instructions in the readme to install a nanopyx environment.

4. Create a branch for local development::

   `$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature`

   Now you can make your changes locally.
