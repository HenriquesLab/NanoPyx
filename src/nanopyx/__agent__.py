        Agent responsabilities:
            1. Store the current state of the machine (e.g. OS, CPU, RAM, GPU, Python version etc.);
            2. Store the current state of ALL initialized LE objects (e.g. anything that is currently running, anything that is scheduled to run,
                runs previously executed in the current session etc.);
            3. Whenever a LE object wants to run, it must query the Agent on what is the best implementation for it;
            4. Tests whether there was an unexpected delay and adjust following paths based on it;
