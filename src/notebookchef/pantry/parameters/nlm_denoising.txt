# NLM Denoising Parameters:

- **Patch size:** Size of patches used for denoising.
- **Patch distance:** Maximal pixel distance to search patches used for denoising.
- **h:** Cut-off distance (in gray levels). A higher h results in a smoother image, at the expense of blurring features. For a Gaussian noise of standard deviation sigma, a rule of thumb is to choose the value of h to be sigma of slightly less.
- **sigma:** The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise.
