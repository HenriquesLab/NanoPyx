To use this notebook you don't need to interact with any code, just run cells in order and a graphical user interface will pop-up showcasing the parameters for each step.
When running this notebook on Colab, it will automatically prompt you to connect to your google Drive, from where you can select the input data.
To save the output of this notebook, make sure to select the "save output" option. Output will be saved on the same directory as the loaded image. If using an example dataset it will be saved on the path Python is currently running (if locally running the notebook) or on Colab files (if running on Colab, files button on the left bar).
